# 3D-Printable-Desk-Mat-
!!This page is in progress!! (+I'm new to GitHub so it might take a minute)

An open source, 3D printable, scalable, and customizable desk mat to fit your personal needs. Created by Tyler Szymanski as a personal Engineering project using resources from the University of Alabama. Current project goals can be found in the ReadMe and will be updated as goals change. 

Premise:
The foundational idea behind this project is that you likely spend a lot of time at your desk working, so you probably want to work at a desk that works for you. This project aims to bring you closer to that goal at a low cost, without sacrificing quality. 

Disclamers:
All files are created for use on the Bambu A1 without AMS and have tolerances/features that may not be viable for you if you use a different machine. This is a personal project that has no external support. All time and resources invested into this project are my own, so please be patient with updates and general support. All Engineering goals are made with the intent of being adressed at some point and will be more detailed in a technical document (To be posted as of writing). Goals will also be listed in order of importance (Top is more likely to be adressed than bottom) but may not be resolved in that order. 

Engineering Goals:
1) Finish creating Tiles and Grid components.
2) Reduce material cost (weight).
3) Finish creating file structures.
4) Finish initial publication online.

If you do not see an item you would like to see adressed in this list or the "issues" tab of the GitHub, please add it!
